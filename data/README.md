The sample dataset `US_CS_adjacency.dat` represents the North American faculty hiring network in Computer Science. It can be found at http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/facultyhiring/. 
An edge `node1 node2 weight` means that a number of `weight` faculties with a PhD obtained at institution `node1` have been hired at institution `node2`.    

The file `US_CS_nodes.dat` contains information about the nodes, specifically it maps the integer node ids to the names of the institutions.

The SpringRank scores are shown in `US_CS_SpringRank_a0.0_l0_1.0_l1_1.0.dat` and they refer to a choice of parameters `alpha=0` and `l_0=l_1=1`.
